            <h2>History of the Game</h2>
            <p>Mahjong is based on draw-and-discard card games that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.[21] They were played with a stripped deck of money-suited cards. Each deck is divided into three suits of Cash or coins, Strings of cash, and Myriads of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three wild cards: Red flower, White flower, and Old thousand. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.</p>

            <h2>Rules and Gameplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Let the South Wind draw and discard a tile to start the round. The South Wind can pick up a tile and look it. If they want to keep it, they must discard a tile from their hand. Otherwise, they can discard the one they picked up. When picking up a tile from the wall, you continue from the point where you stopped when the tiles were dealt and keep moving in the same direction; if you have a pile, just take any tile from the pile.</li>
                <li>Allow the South Wind to discard the tile and say the name. Every time you pick up a tile, either one a person has discarded or one from the draw pile, you must discard a tile from your hand. Place the tile on the table, and then say the name of the tile so that others can claim it.</li>
                <li>Claim a tile as it's discarded if it fits one of your melds. If the tile completes a pong, meaning you already have the other 2 tiles in your hand, you can say "pong" and claim the discarded tile. Similarly, you can claim the tile if it completes a kong or chow in your hand, and you say it aloud when you claim it. Then, you must show the meld and put it on the table to prove it. This type of claiming goes in the order of players with one exception: if the tile would allow a player to win mahjong, they get the tile.</li>
                <li>Pick up a tile from the draw pile to play if you don't want a discarded tile. If no one claims the discarded tile, then the next player to the right of the person discarding picks up a tile from the draw pile/wall. Once you rack a tile, no one can claim the previously discarded tile.</li>
                <li>Continue in the order of players to the right. Once someone claims a discarded tile, play goes to the right of that player, even if they weren't the next player in line to go. Whenever a discarded tile is claimed, the turn skips to that person, and then play continues from them.</li>
                <li>Replace a joker with a tile from your hand on your turn. If someone lays down a meld with a joker and you have the tile that replaces the joker, you can put down the tile. Then, you can claim the joker to use in your hand.</li>
                <li>Work on forming melds. Melds are sets of tiles you play together. You can play 3 of the same tile ("pongs") or 4 of the same tile ("kongs"). These tiles can be suits, honor tiles, or bonus tiles. You can also play 3 numbers in a row, called a chow.</li>
                <li>Make a mahjong with 4 melds and a pair. The mahjong hand uses all the tiles in your hand, which is 13, plus 1 you won't discard. You'll need 4 melds, which can be a combination of pongs, kongs, and chows, plus 1 pair. Any bonus tiles will also give you points.</li>
            </ul>
